You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.	2015-08-31

US	28282645	R3MBE6UCH3435E	B00TE8XKIS	35563334	Polaroid ZIP Mobile Printer Parent ASIN	Camera	3	8	8	N	N	Fun toy for making stickers, but expensive to play with.	The printer came in a small fairly plain box with decent packaging.  Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.

I'm on a business trip and have had a lot of time to play with it. The camera is very easy to use and comes with quite a lot. Video quality is really good 1080p at 30 fps compared to gopro's 60fps, but honestly you can't tell a difference. There are many different apps to use with this camera, I like Final Cam but SJCam works as well. With the recommended 32Gb micro sd card the camera can record for over 5 hours. I have not tested to see if the battery lasts that long yet, but i haven't had to recharge it since the first charge. Video's are broken down into 3 minute segments to make data file sizes smaller, although this can be changed to 5 or 10 minutes as well. Pictures turn out well as well, many options for this, maximum quality is 14 Megapixels 4320x3240. I would recommend this to anyone, Gopro's price at ~$400 is not worth it in my opinion. Exceeded all expectations.	2015-08-31

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!	2015-08-31

Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.<br /><br />The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.  The base is heavy enough and seems secure.  Enough control points are provided, allowing you to hold down slides.  Note-  I was provided a sample for a no obligation review.	2015-08-31

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)	2015-08-31

Their price is pretty competitive.  Setup (at least by the instruction book) is a real pia but the pics are very good. once it is setup. Lens is too fast, or too slow to catch EVERYTHING, (forget cars...) and preview lcd is non-existent, night pics are not very good unless your subject is within 30' or so, but the daylight pics are VERY good, great color.  Comes with a stretch strap; you don't realize how great a two piece buckle stretch strap is until you have to take a camera off of a tree to change batteries...  Battery life is good, don't use the included batteries, use a good quality alkaline instead.  Shop around, this unit is pretty cheap, (under a $100 in some places),and pretty good quality too.

The tripod is one of the flimsiest tripods I have ever seen.  The head is made of plastic and sags under the weight of my camera. I has to find something ro wedge into the head so the camera woukd sit level. In the week I have been using it, I've had to ask my subjects to sit quietly once i frame the shot and wait until the camera stops swaying before I start recording using the remote because I don't dare touch the camera at this point.  It might do wekk for a smaller lighter camera but will still feel and act like the flimsy crap that it is.<br /><br />According to the ad the bag is supposed to fit a Panasonic AG-HMC80.  It almost does.  It is a quality bag with Vivitar's logos, so don't get me wrong.  Once I took out all the paddef partitions I was able to get the HMC80 into it, laying the camera on its side, just barely and the pressure the top puts on the view finder worries me a bit. It would be a great bag for a smaller camera.	2015-08-31

I have been using the Kodak CFH-V15 for the past month and I must say that I've been impressed. I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.	2015-08-31

Camera	4	0	0	N	N	Inexpensive lens, performs ok.	I wasn't sure what to expect from this lens when I got it, but it just gives you more viewing area, and it's as if it is zoomed out.<br /><br />It does not work on my ZTE Concord II, because my camera lens is down about half an inch too far.  It would be great if this clip had the ability to extend, then it would fit any phone. It does however, fit my brother's Moto G, and my other LG Optimus Fuel smartphone.<br /><br />I'm not sure how often I would use this lens when I can just zoom out.  I think for certain artistic photos, this would be good for, but not for every day photos.<br /><br />I am giving it a 4, because it works like it says it does, but personally, I am not fond of it.  My photos appear fine when looking at them on the phone, but after they upload, they are a little blurry.  It does come with a pouch to keep it in, and a lens cap when it's not in use.  The cap does come off easily.....maybe a little too easily for me.  I could see it getting lost pretty quickly.<br /><br />I can get similar effect on photos using free editing software.  This fisheye lens is very inexpensive, only $5 so you aren't out much money if you want to give it a try though.<br /><br />*Sample provided at a discount for testing and review.	2015-08-31

At best it can be consider a clone of the SJCAM 5000 with 60fps. at its price its not bad and works well. The website actually doesn't even show this product let alone any type of support should you need to contact them. I own both SJCAM 4000 and the SJcam 5000+ best i can say you could compare this with the SJCAM 5000 but sadly there is NO way to control the MIC volume like the SJ5000 the volume control on this camera actually only controls the audio of the BEEP sound.<br />You should expect the same problems such as overheating of the unit in 80.F to 100.F. which could lead to the camera not recording leaving you no choice but to remove the battery to reset the unit.<br /> Audit is poor at best it captures all the sound around you, you would think that is a good however it AMPLIFIES it meaning you should expect increase in distortion, with no way to change it you better rely on software to remove or normalizes it. I would recommend waiting for something better. Also the anti shake makes things worst by creating Z fighting or blurring the video. best keep it off and just use software to try to fix it or better yet just stay with 60fps.	2015-08-31

Living in crime-ridden South Africa and having been the victim of armed house robbery myself, I just had to get a back-up system for my existing system (passive infrared radio- alarm linked to response company) to give additional peace of mind. Eventually I resorted to a Chinese GSM system but if you have ever tried that out you will know the term ' user unfriendly' was specifically created to decribe those systems. In came Korner and what a pleasant experience!<br />A few remarks:<br />One piece door contacts and real pleasing on the eye!<br />Absolutely user friendly - even a child can install them.<br />Direct control via an App on your phone.<br />Long battery life<br />The whole system is plug and  play.<br />Korner will send you an email as well as a pop-up on your phone if intrusion is detected.<br />Korner can be used as a door chime if not armed - so you can still monitor movement through the house even when it is disarmed.<br />Allthough the tags are meant to be used with doors/windows, I've dropped one in portable safebox at home and it works perfectly well to register movement of the box.<br />Very nice feature is that you can actually set up a circle of friends to be notified of intrusions - one can create your own personal neighbourhood watch system.<br />Customer service is excellent - I had a few questions/issues and time and again I was assisted in a prompt and efficient manner. Love the fact that the system is updated continiously (OTA) with new features and improvements.<br />The whole system is portable - so you can take it along if you move.<br />It deserves a 5/5.<br />Francois, South Africa	2015-08-31

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty.

What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize.

Unfortunately, it's just another faulty action cam.  Too bad, I really, really wanted this device to be the answer to an otherwise expensive prayer.  I got this for my husband who has been looking at the GoPro devices.  I didn't want him spending $300-400 on a 'toy' so I picked this one out for him.  It seems like a great idea: inexpensive action camera with GoPro mounting compatibility and lots of accessories as well.<br /><br />We got it and he put it on his motorcycle to get some video of his daily commute and travels.  It appears to have worked well for about 25 miles, then the video went wacky; in and out of focus, strange colors (it was shot at night, since that's when he goes to work), so something happened while it was mounted on the bike.  The next morning he shot his ride home during daylight and it became evident what happened: the IR pass filter had come loose and was wiggling about in the housing, causing color and focus issues.<br /><br />Too bad.  We did find the 'entry' level [[ASIN:B00NIYNUXO GoPro HERO (No Wi-Fi)]]and we'll give that a try next, but this one had to go back!  :(  Other than that, this really seemed like a great little unit with features that GoPro has for $300.  Great quality case and the wifi funtionality worked great.  The colors and pictures seemed high quality (until it went south, of course)  If one or the other of these Asian companies would institute a higher level of quality control, they could really rule the action cam market.  Oh well, two stars for the effort though!	2015-08-31

We are using this as a baby monitor. We first got the older version of this because it was $20 cheaper. It took 2 hours to figure out how to hook it up to the wifi. Then, when we tried to download the app on our phones, it said it didn't work with the older model. We returned it for this plug and play. You literally just scan the QR Code and within 5 minutes the whole thing is set up and works with the app. Image is fantastic and night vision looks great too. Tons of features that we probably won't even use, but good to have. Also has a mic and speaker so you can hear your baby and talk to them. You can set the volume in the app so that the alarm is more or less sensitive to sound. Highly recommend, especially for under $80!  Update: Feb 2017: Camera has had a lot of glitches over the 1.5yrs we've had it, including disconnecting from the wifi on a regular basis. It freezes when watching on your phone, so you have to close out and go back in. Now, after 1.5yrs, it has completely stopped working.	2015-08-31

So, I don't write reviews, but I read a lot. This one finally made me feel I have to write something. I have bought several baby monitors before when my older kids young. Finally, I returned them all. Either the function design is not right, or the parameter is low, like, resolution. This one made me really impressed, and it's cheaper than all my previous tries. I can feel the builders really tried their best to make every detail perfect. I believe you can feel it too. It's not HD (1920x1080). I'm a resolution fan, but 1280x720 really works, and made the budget low.	2015-08-31

Sometimes it loads Instagram and other times it says &#34;Cannot load the Instagram login page, try later&#34;.

However the screen is actually a good size. The &#34;classic&#34; look of this cube is basically the Instagram logo as pictured, which looks great but is disappointing since the rainbow is a sticky tape that was already peeling when I received this unit.<br /><br />Two stars for effort and ease of use.	2015-08-31

It took a while to ship and arrive but I have had it working for about 3 weeks. I read many of the reviews before buying which helped a lot. For the price this is just what I wanted. I used the trick putting tape over the eye to shrink its view and now it doesn't go off all the time. I hung it about waist high so animals aren't setting it off much. Also put silicone around the seem of the case for the outside unit. I could see where this would exten its life. As of right now for the money I think it was more than worth it. I like this unit for the money because with a little extra effort it should last.	2015-08-31

LOVE the ability to charge my 70D battery on the go!	I am forever misplacing the battery charger for our Canon 70D so I decided that it was time to order a back-up! This charger by Indie Camera Gear seems to charge just as fast as my Canon charger, and I love how compact it is so it doesn't take up extra outlets when plugged into the wall! It has a red light that comes on when charging and it turns green when it is fully-charged. This charger also has overcharging protection, meaning that you can leave it plugged in overnight and it won't fry your battery! Considering a replacement 70D Canon battery runs about $60, it is VERY nice to have that extra protection! I actually missed that there would be a car charging cable included when I ordered this, so I was thrilled to find that cable in the box! I take a crazy number of photographs every day and one thing I'm not so good about is remembering to stop and charge the battery! This is extra cable plugs directly into the charger and allows you to charge your battery while you are on the go! I love having a car charger for vacations as well because how often do you remember, or have time to charge your camera battery at the hotel? I purchased this charger during a limited promotional period at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for either a back-up or a replacement charger! It sure beats spending $50-80 for an OEM charger!	2015-08-31

I've used the 560 III and IV and loved them! Some issues I had with this unit were related to Master/Slave wireless sync but it was a Canon related problem (camera related -- I have a 5D Mark2 which I still use as a backup). Heads up if you're using this on a Canon 5DMark2! On the newer 5DMark3 the issues are resolved.<br /><br />What I could not get past was battery power usage. I have never had a flash unit that would eat up through batteries so fast!  Some users complained about the unit wasting battery power when off. I did not test that so I can't say for sure. But under normal use, the same use as my old 560III's or the newer 560IV's, these things were abysmal! During a wedding, I'd be busy changing batteries all night long! Never an issue with the aforementioned units, which I'm still successfully using.<br /><br />Also, the firmware upgrade can ONLY be done on a Windows 32bit operating system. Insane! I don't even have access to a &#34;32bit&#34; Windows OS anymore!<br /><br />Otherwise, the design, menus, etc are great. Everything else worked and quite well. I shoot in Manual all the time so TTL is pretty useless to me but it worked well when tested. HSS also worked well. It's a new product. I'm sure subsequent versions will have these issues fixed. When they fix them, this flash will be a great thing to have!<br /><br />Sent them back. Really felt bad about it because I was really happy to have them but they just didn't work for me (yet).	2015-08-31

Both the dropcam and nest cam have an embarrassingly bad WIFI algorithm when there are multiple access points with the same name (SID) near it.  (I have a tall house and I need multiple WIFI access points)  When you have this situation, the cameras lose connectivity all the time. The obvious workaround is to dedicate a WIFI access point specifically for the Nest Cam, which is annoying.  Why Nest can't or won't fix this is beyond me.

It has rounded corners and a big screen, making the camera look good.  But I have concluded that In spite of increasing the optical zoom range, and increasing the imager from 12 to 16 megapixels, the 340HS is not as good a camera as it's predecessor, the 330HS.  I own both.<br /><br />The 330HS has the Digic5 processor, which is faster and allows the use of 3200 and 6400 ISO speeds with some loss of color quality but not horrible colored snow.  The 340HS has the older Digic4 processor which is capped at ISO 3200, and cannot take full images at the burst speed that the 330HS will do.  While increasing the optical zoom the designers reduced the maximum aperture from f3.0 to f3.6.  In low light you have the triple disadvantages of a slower lens, a less-capable processor, and more pixels crowded on an imager of the same size.<br /><br />But the worst part is that many of the manual features available on the 330HS are not present on the 340HS.  One that I miss is forced flash, such as you might want to use when your subject is backlighted by a window.  The camera also displays a ridiculous set of altered photos, including monochrome, of every photo you take.<br /><br />My 330HS connects wirelessly to my computer but I've been unable to get the 340HS to do so in spite of reading the manual and using Canon's wifi connection software.  I've read that others have made the connection successfully.<br /><br />The 340HS appears to be a triumph of style over substance.  Canon can do better.	2015-08-31

While the footage does record, I am unable to access the card from PC including after unmounting from the camera setting. I am always asked to format it on my PC. I've tried three different computers and four memory sticks. It seems now the only way to get footage off is by clicking 'download' through the web interface and waiting in real-time for the footage to transfer. The interface is still just as horrendous and unusable as it was when I wrote my initial review so long ago.  The camera quality is acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary these days (it is comparable to the 808 #16 keychain camera, if that). It was easy enough to connect (you have to use physical LAN cable at first) but the built-in WiFi is weak and I found difficulty getting steady signal when it was placed one floor below while the rest of my WiFi-enabled devices worked fine. My biggest gripe is the horrendous interface they force upon you when accessing the camera through the web interface. First you are prompted to install some very cryptic and unknown proprietary plugin / ActiveX control that links to the &#34;Shenzhm Mining Technology&#34; website, which I guess is an affiliation of the developer of this camera. To get motion recording to work you have to enable the alarm action as well (which bombards your phone with notifactions with each motion until you disable notifications via the phone settings), and you cannot use the scheduler if using motion detection. I have set this up to point outside but had to then buy a mechanical timer to power the camera off at night and on in the day since there is no way to remotely power it off or schedule motion recording for only a particular period of time. When you want to see what has been recorded through the Web interface, you go to the &#34;Messages&#34; screen where each record appears twice (once for 'alarm motion' and oncefor 'record'). Only 30 rows are shown at a time and the thumbnail snapshots are microscopic at 80x40 pixels. You can view a larger snapshot by clicking the thumbnail but can only view one snapshot at a time and have to close it to open another instead of just having a prev/next button. The videos have no controls for playback and there is no natural way to download them from the device without taking the MicroSD card out. When you want to see more records you have to endlessly click &#34;More30Records&#34; which is a terrible UX design. I have taken to the extreme of manually modifying styles and local script behavior via Stylish and GreaseMonkey plugins to make the interface slightly more bearable. If you know the device's IP you can connect locally, connecting through their own site for viewing was very sluggish. Next time around I would spend a little more money for a more industry-standard IP camera.	2015-08-31

Not much, but if you are a climber it's a hard sell. -Body is not truly weather sealed, no gaskets on camera lense.  I love its features and picture quality.

The seller sold it from Singapore without disclosing it, so I didn't have warranty coverage in the U.S., but Amazon refunded me. There weren't any others of the same model available by that point, so I don't know for sure whether my issue was a one-off. But I sure hope so! ---  In replacing a Canon that cost just $70 over two years ago ([[ASIN:B004HW73S4 Canon Powershot A1200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom (Black)]]), I didn't have very demanding needs: I wanted a better zoom and USB charging instead of AA batteries, and similar or better picture quality. This Samsung made a good first impression but didn't live up to that standard.  It starts by turning on super-quickly, a revelation compared to my old Canon. But looks were deceiving -- you can't actually take a picture for the first few seconds after it comes on. The zoom pops out and the screen lights up, but if you press the button to take the picture, it gives you nothing. You have to release, wait a few seconds, then try again. Utterly infuriating when you've whipped out the camera to try and quickly shoot something before it's gone.  The picture quality also ranges wildly, from decent to unacceptable. A large number of pictures come out unfocused, and no adjustments changed that view from being a complete blur. At other times, colors come out fine at one second and unnatural the next, as in the examples. (White cars on a sunny day were particularly susceptible to being badly washed out.) Most of the time the camera's screen is clear enough to let you know that you have a bad picture and should try again; others no.  The camera isn't without merits. The zoom is great for such a compact camera, the WiFi was a nice feature, and the battery seems to have a pretty long life. But I can't count on it to take an adequate picture, to the point that on a recent trip I ended up ditching it into my backpack and settling for my phone. I'd figured that reliably taking okay pictures was a given even at a fairly low price, but apparently that's no longer the case. I'll be buying something higher-end.	2015-08-31

A very nice product to have if you use alot of 9v batteries. The best thing to do is first read the directions a few times. Another thing to know, at least in my case, this isn't a quick process. I tried to re-charge a battery and it took the better part of a day. Now as you can see it has 4 ports and each port can be programmed to different settings. This is so nice because you can put rechargeable and other types in the same unit. One last thing to keepin mmind, use this in a clear area, the unit tends to get warm when charging and have it on a level surface. all in all, a nice thing to have.	2015-08-31

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!	2015-08-31

Lens	Camera	5	9	9	N	N	Don't Over Look This Lens	This is the first lens I bought for my Lumix G1, the reason, having no experience with Lumix lenses, was that Panasonic claimed that this lens was developed by Leica for the M4/3 system.  I have owned this lens for many years now. Frankly, I have not been disappointed.  The lens is impressive as it yields sharp balanced images,  I was not really expecting much at the the time, but it has proven to be a good value.  Since then I have bought many other Lumix and Leica lenses for my G1 and GX7, but I still use this lens frequently.  Last week I decided to give away my entire Nikon system that I used in my profession, a tough decision letting go of and old friend, but I had not really picked it up since I bought this lens. This lens has dampened focusing, or so it seems, and is easy to focus accurately, it is certainly a faster focusing lens than my equivalent Nikkors.  It is light weight.  I carry it in a fishing vest, along with several other lenses. and it gets bounce and banged around when I scurry up and down slopes to get a good position and it has held up well.  In terms of image characteristics it performs similar to my Zeiss lenses on my Hasselblad.  I like to make oversized prints and this lens serves well.  Lumix makes so many good lenses it is hard to know which to buy, I don't regret this purchase.  As a user of may old lenses by Zeiss, Leica and Schneider I would put this lens in the same class. The selection of glass has always been highly subjective relative to one's photographic tastes, so look at some test images to get a feel for the lens.  I really like it.	2015-08-31

Yes it takes a while (lots of steps) but it's relatively easy compared to other systems.<br />- There are a ton of features--everything from motion detection (which works wonderful) to an email alert system when it detects something (you have to be hooked up to a wired network of course).  You can also schedule out when exactly you want it to record (e.g. after business hours).<br />- Easy navigation: Just need a mouse (included). Click around and right click to \\"go back\\" in the navigation.<br />- Very smooth, excellent quality footage.  Not like that choppy stuff you see on old CCTV security systems.<br />- Tons of long cables. 60 foot cables (8 of them!). Note: Due to the length of the cable, there's a slight 1 second delay from the event to when you see it on your monitor.<br />- Full metal, tough camera design.<br />- Awesome in low-light/darkness. Infrared lights work wonderfully to light up the room when it's dark. (of course the human eye can't see infrared, but it lights up enough for the camera to film everything)<br />- Incredibly good price here on Amazon. Just factor in a hard drive and a monitor.<br /><br />Overall I am very impressed with this camera system. An excellent bang for your buck, especially considering how many cameras they give you.<br /><br />I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely.	2015-08-31

Worked well for a few days and then one of the legs just broke. When i looked where it broke, it shows a cheap quality aluminium metal which breaks so easily! Even the sponge around the legs is tore after a couple of twists! There are better quality ones out there...stay away.<br /><br />[Update - 10/12]: The seller has good customer service and they contacted me regarding the issue. They acknowledged that the covering on the legs should not tear so easily and be able to withstand many many bends. Secondly, I am told this product cannot be used much in the form it shown in the picture...according to the seller, the legs are too bent if you do it as shown in picture. They sent me another piece free of cost to try out again. I have used it for last month or so and it works well - don't bend it excessively.	2015-08-31

One small disadvantage is that you do need a Windows computer running Internet Explorer so you can utilize the plug-in to configure the camera. The image is very good quality, and the IR is very good at night, pretty decent visibility up to 15-20 feet away. After turning motion detection on, and configuring a schedule, I'm impressed with the results. The camera does take snapshots of detected motion, without many false negatives. For now the one camera does what I need, but if I had to add another camera I would choose to buy the same one again. I think the price for this camera makes it the perfect purchase for a home or apartment.	2015-08-31

These lights are made for photographers and film-makers, and they work great. They're easy to attach and aim, durable for transport, and are reliable when you need them for your livelihood. I just bought these to replace Tota lights  that literally worked for decades (occasional use, but still...)

For some people their favorite things are their Porsche and their Prada handbag, these lights are on my shortlist of favorite things.	2015-08-31

Now both flashes are under Canon´s RT system and can be managed by the Canon ST-E3 or by the Yongnuo version.

This remote is not for your camera hot shoe, you will use them with cold shoes that usually have their own system or even better the shoe of this remote have 1/4 screw hole so you can easily tight it directly to a stand.	2015-08-31

I bought the 2-way rail after purchasing the Neewer video camera stabilizer. The stabilizer comes with a fairly easy to adjust front-to-back rail, but it's very difficult to balance the camera using the built-in  left-to-right adjustment. So, I bought this rail, added it to the top of the stabilizer and can now make tiny left-to-right adjustments to get the rig in balance.<br /><br />It appears to be all metal and has two 1/4&#34;x20 screws for attaching your camera. One is fixed in place, the other is adjustable. The top of the rail (where the camera sits) has a textured rubber covering that prevents slipping.	2015-08-31

This camera works great for the cost. So well in fact I bought 2.  It has a lot of features and is easy to set up but you need to have WiFi and ethernet connection for the initial set up. It works great with both android and apple smart phones simultaneously.<br /><br />Now the cons: pan and tilt are rather slow and it is easy to over run where you want the camera pointed. The power cable is only about 3 feet long so you have to buy DC power extension cables in order to mount the camera high up on a wall or ceiling. NOTE! you need the 1.3mm x 3.5mm size, that you can buy in various lengths on Amazon. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5!	2015-08-31

The fabric, zippers, everything is made with great materials and well designed. I bought this to hold my Canon 70D with a 24-105mm (attached) and a 70-200 2.8 IS II and I believe it still have space for a 600EX RT flash or maybe another lens.<br /><br />The only reason I´m giving this bag 4 stars is because of the pocket size for the laptop. Although I know this bag was designed to hold a 13 inch laptop you need to take into consideration that it will only hold the laptop without any protective case or cover. In my case I have a 13 inch Macbook Pro non retina and I had to remove the cover in order to use the pocket. And it fit so tight that is kind of difficult to extract the laptop, maybe because the aluminum case of the Macbook Pro is so smooth you can hardly have a good grip. Maybe designers should take the covers size in consideration and leave some room to easily extract the laptop.	2015-08-31

Had to run all the cat6 wires to where I was going to set up my cameras since these are indoor camera wanted to make sure they did not get wet.  One thing that you must do before installing the camera is to program them to the NVR to make sure they work before you put them up. I suggest doing this first. The instructions are not to clear about doing this. I had to call Amcrest technical support for the NVR. It took a while to get through but they were very helpful and also assisted me setting up my phone app that I downloaded from the Play store. You have to download the right app for whatever phone you are using or it will not work. For the Samsung Galaxy phones I downloaded the  Amcrest view lite app. it work fine so far. Over all for the price these are pretty good cameras I like the option that the can pan and tilt to get a better view of the area. The have a built in speaker which I have not gotten to work with the NVR yet you can also use a Microphone with them still working on that. Write more at a later date when figured out how to make them work.	2015-08-31

If you are using a GE or Interlogix panel with this model it should be very easy to add to your existing system. Be sure to download your wireless panel's user manual, as you these smoke alarms usually need to go onto a dedicated group/zone, and be setup as a specific sensor. If you are using a monitored Concord 4 system, be sure to add the sensor text as &#34;smoke or fire alarm,&#34; and perhaps a location (which I did not as I don't really care where the fire or smoke is, I just want to know my house is on fire) so that the monitoring company will know that it's a fire emergency and not a police emergency. If you don't name this sensor I believe it will only tell the monitoring company that Sensor #XX has been tripped. I would recommend getting more than one unit for your home, and installing these yourself as it's free. It's definitely simple enough to do by yourself, provided you follow the instructions closely.  Update: My spouse burned some bacon this morning and this thing definitely works. It's quite sensitive. It's not in the kitchen but near it.	2015-08-31

The SmaPole F1 Gopro handle is made of a carbon fiber body and metal gopro mount. I think Smatree made a great handle even better by using these materials. I have another brand handle but it's constructed of plastic and foam for the handle. Smatree took it a step further and used a much lighter and stronger material which is great. The SmapPole is longer than my other handle by about 4-5&#34; but this brings the camera further away giving a little bit more distance giving you a wider shot. I do see one thing that many mention, is that it has no grip built in the carbon fiber handle. This is very minor being that they include a detachable wrist lanyard that has an adjustable lock to keep it from sliding off your wrist. For those of you who have a mini tripod, you can screw the end of this handle to extend the height. All in all, I think this is a great product for the price being that it's made of real carbon fiber and all metal construction. I was given a sample product to evaluate and give my honest opinion.	2015-08-31
