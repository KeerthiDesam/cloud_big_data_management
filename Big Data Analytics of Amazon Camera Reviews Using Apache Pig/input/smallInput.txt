You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.	2015-08-31

US	28282645	R3MBE6UCH3435E	B00TE8XKIS	35563334	Polaroid ZIP Mobile Printer Parent ASIN	Camera	3	8	8	N	N	Fun toy for making stickers, but expensive to play with.	The printer came in a small fairly plain box with decent packaging.  Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.

I'm on a business trip and have had a lot of time to play with it. The camera is very easy to use and comes with quite a lot. Video quality is really good 1080p at 30 fps compared to gopro's 60fps, but honestly you can't tell a difference. There are many different apps to use with this camera, I like Final Cam but SJCam works as well. With the recommended 32Gb micro sd card the camera can record for over 5 hours. I have not tested to see if the battery lasts that long yet, but i haven't had to recharge it since the first charge. Video's are broken down into 3 minute segments to make data file sizes smaller, although this can be changed to 5 or 10 minutes as well. Pictures turn out well as well, many options for this, maximum quality is 14 Megapixels 4320x3240. I would recommend this to anyone, Gopro's price at ~$400 is not worth it in my opinion. Exceeded all expectations.	2015-08-31

The box contains the following:<br />• The camera<br />• Ethernet (network) cable<br />• Power adapter<br />• Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />• Software CD (Mini CD)<br />• Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended. Note - this camera may be available froma few sellers, so make sure you price compare before buying!s, so make sure you price compare before buying!	2015-08-31

Packed inside the box is the USB microscope, stand, USB cable, an installation software (CD) a manual, a quick start guide, and calibration chart.  However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.<br /><br />The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.  The base is heavy enough and seems secure.  Enough control points are provided, allowing you to hold down slides.  Note-  I was provided a sample for a no obligation review.	2015-08-31

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)	2015-08-31

Their price is pretty competitive.  Setup (at least by the instruction book) is a real pia but the pics are very good. once it is setup. Lens is too fast, or too slow to catch EVERYTHING, (forget cars...) and preview lcd is non-existent, night pics are not very good unless your subject is within 30' or so, but the daylight pics are VERY good, great color.  Comes with a stretch strap; you don't realize how great a two piece buckle stretch strap is until you have to take a camera off of a tree to change batteries...  Battery life is good, don't use the included batteries, use a good quality alkaline instead.  Shop around, this unit is pretty cheap, (under a $100 in some places),and pretty good quality too.

The tripod is one of the flimsiest tripods I have ever seen.  The head is made of plastic and sags under the weight of my camera. I has to find something ro wedge into the head so the camera woukd sit level. In the week I have been using it, I've had to ask my subjects to sit quietly once i frame the shot and wait until the camera stops swaying before I start recording using the remote because I don't dare touch the camera at this point.  It might do wekk for a smaller lighter camera but will still feel and act like the flimsy crap that it is.<br /><br />According to the ad the bag is supposed to fit a Panasonic AG-HMC80.  It almost does.  It is a quality bag with Vivitar's logos, so don't get me wrong.  Once I took out all the paddef partitions I was able to get the HMC80 into it, laying the camera on its side, just barely and the pressure the top puts on the view finder worries me a bit. It would be a great bag for a smaller camera.	2015-08-31

I have been using the Kodak CFH-V15 for the past month and I must say that I've been impressed. I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.	2015-08-31

Camera	4	0	0	N	N	Inexpensive lens, performs ok.	I wasn't sure what to expect from this lens when I got it, but it just gives you more viewing area, and it's as if it is zoomed out.<br /><br />It does not work on my ZTE Concord II, because my camera lens is down about half an inch too far.  It would be great if this clip had the ability to extend, then it would fit any phone. It does however, fit my brother's Moto G, and my other LG Optimus Fuel smartphone.<br /><br />I'm not sure how often I would use this lens when I can just zoom out.  I think for certain artistic photos, this would be good for, but not for every day photos.<br /><br />I am giving it a 4, because it works like it says it does, but personally, I am not fond of it.  My photos appear fine when looking at them on the phone, but after they upload, they are a little blurry.  It does come with a pouch to keep it in, and a lens cap when it's not in use.  The cap does come off easily.....maybe a little too easily for me.  I could see it getting lost pretty quickly.<br /><br />I can get similar effect on photos using free editing software.  This fisheye lens is very inexpensive, only $5 so you aren't out much money if you want to give it a try though.<br /><br />*Sample provided at a discount for testing and review.	2015-08-31

At best it can be consider a clone of the SJCAM 5000 with 60fps. at its price its not bad and works well. The website actually doesn't even show this product let alone any type of support should you need to contact them. I own both SJCAM 4000 and the SJcam 5000+ best i can say you could compare this with the SJCAM 5000 but sadly there is NO way to control the MIC volume like the SJ5000 the volume control on this camera actually only controls the audio of the BEEP sound.<br />You should expect the same problems such as overheating of the unit in 80.F to 100.F. which could lead to the camera not recording leaving you no choice but to remove the battery to reset the unit.<br /> Audit is poor at best it captures all the sound around you, you would think that is a good however it AMPLIFIES it meaning you should expect increase in distortion, with no way to change it you better rely on software to remove or normalizes it. I would recommend waiting for something better. Also the anti shake makes things worst by creating Z fighting or blurring the video. best keep it off and just use software to try to fix it or better yet just stay with 60fps.	2015-08-31

Living in crime-ridden South Africa and having been the victim of armed house robbery myself, I just had to get a back-up system for my existing system (passive infrared radio- alarm linked to response company) to give additional peace of mind. Eventually I resorted to a Chinese GSM system but if you have ever tried that out you will know the term ' user unfriendly' was specifically created to decribe those systems. In came Korner and what a pleasant experience!<br />A few remarks:<br />One piece door contacts and real pleasing on the eye!<br />Absolutely user friendly - even a child can install them.<br />Direct control via an App on your phone.<br />Long battery life<br />The whole system is plug and  play.<br />Korner will send you an email as well as a pop-up on your phone if intrusion is detected.<br />Korner can be used as a door chime if not armed - so you can still monitor movement through the house even when it is disarmed.<br />Allthough the tags are meant to be used with doors/windows, I've dropped one in portable safebox at home and it works perfectly well to register movement of the box.<br />Very nice feature is that you can actually set up a circle of friends to be notified of intrusions - one can create your own personal neighbourhood watch system.<br />Customer service is excellent - I had a few questions/issues and time and again I was assisted in a prompt and efficient manner. Love the fact that the system is updated continiously (OTA) with new features and improvements.<br />The whole system is portable - so you can take it along if you move.<br />It deserves a 5/5.<br />Francois, South Africa	2015-08-31

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR. We are regrettably unable to offer repair work outside of the 1 year warranty.

What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website? There is an 8 Channel DVR with a 500 GB hard drive for $74.99.<br />9:49 AM Kristi: We are unable to offer a larger discount then 10%, regrettably.<br />9:50 AM William Rooks: I have to tell you that it is also frustrating that defender offers a telephone support line that, after dialing extensions for 15 minutes, merely re-routes you to the website.	2015-08-31

Unfortunately, it's just another faulty action cam.  Too bad, I really, really wanted this device to be the answer to an otherwise expensive prayer.  I got this for my husband who has been looking at the GoPro devices.  I didn't want him spending $300-400 on a 'toy' so I picked this one out for him.  It seems like a great idea: inexpensive action camera with GoPro mounting compatibility and lots of accessories as well.<br /><br />We got it and he put it on his motorcycle to get some video of his daily commute and travels.  It appears to have worked well for about 25 miles, then the video went wacky; in and out of focus, strange colors (it was shot at night, since that's when he goes to work), so something happened while it was mounted on the bike.  The next morning he shot his ride home during daylight and it became evident what happened: the IR pass filter had come loose and was wiggling about in the housing, causing color and focus issues.<br /><br />Too bad.  We did find the 'entry' level [[ASIN:B00NIYNUXO GoPro HERO (No Wi-Fi)]]and we'll give that a try next, but this one had to go back!  :(  Other than that, this really seemed like a great little unit with features that GoPro has for $300.  Great quality case and the wifi funtionality worked great.  The colors and pictures seemed high quality (until it went south, of course)  If one or the other of these Asian companies would institute a higher level of quality control, they could really rule the action cam market.  Oh well, two stars for the effort though!	2015-08-31
