The folder contains the following files: InsertData.java, assignmentPart3.java

Below are the responsibilities of each file:

Firstly convert the dataset into another file which contains 900000 lines using command prompt.
--> head -900000 movies.txt>movies1.txt

InsertData.java
-> create the table and column family 
-> file input stream takes the data set and converts into required format


assignmentPart3.java
-> in this we are using filters to calculate the average of scores(I.e 3,5,0)
-> three filters for each score and then scan the filters to extract the result.
-> calculate the average of score in the product family
-> calculate the average of helpfullness in the product family


Note:
The second part of the assignment is in the command file where we set the version of a column family, add two additional versioned data , show the added data, find the specific substring called touching from the column family product and find the text which does not have alphanumeric values from text column.
